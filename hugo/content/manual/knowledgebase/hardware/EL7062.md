3. [tuning](#tuning)

### error/warning
If the drive is in error/warning state and not possible to enable, see [drive refuse to enable](../../motion/#drive-refuse-to-enable).

The most common reason for this error is:
* motor is not connected
* (PSI specific): motor cable in wrong connector (at PSI motor and limits have the same 5pin M12 connector)
* drive has no motor voltage
* (PSI specific): EL9227-5500 feeding the I/O bus is not initiated (at first power on the switches on the terminal needs to be engaged)

### Openloop counter jump
The EL7062 has a firmware bug if configured to run in open loop CSV.

When disabling the amplifier the open loop counter jump to nearest full turn value.
Beckhoff works on a fix...

### Tuning
{{% notice warning %}}
**Motor might move during tuning sequence**

If tuning is off an autotune sequence can be executed from the hardware expert panel. Teh auto tuning sequence measures coil resistance and inductance and sets initial values for control loop parameters:
* Coil resistance
* Coil inductance
* Current loop proportional gain
* Current loop integration time
* Velocity loop proportional gain
* Velocity loop integration time
* Position loop proportional gain  (used in CSP only)

The autotune process also creates an MACROS string that can be used with ecmccomp to set the parameters at startup.

Requirements for a sucessful tuning:
* Drive must be in OP mode
* Drive must _not_ be enabled
* Drive must have motor power

For more info see Beckhoff docs.

Sometimes further finetuning of the parameters might be needed.
